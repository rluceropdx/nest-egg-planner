# Project Objectives
Develop a "clicker-style" simulator but with a focus on building retirement savings. I intend to keep some things simple (having only 1 or 2 accounts) but extend the range of simulated events such as:
- RMD's (Required Minimum Distributions)
- Roth vs Tax-Advantaged accounts
- Tax Calculation (married filing jointly, single, having dependents)
- Incorporate an average of expenses and the effects inflation
- Health care costs and the effects of inflation
- Recieving Social Security & enrolling in medicare
- Medicare Premiums and it potentially increasing due to RMDs above
- Situations when Social Security is taxed
